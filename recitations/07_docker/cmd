# Typically, the easiest way to learn a command line tool, is to find a cheat sheet. Sometimes, the official documentation can be a little hard to begin with.
# For Docker, the official documentation is very good. But there are a lot of cheat sheets that you can explore too.

# Note: All commands need to have root access. The 'sudo' before every command is omitted. 
# Alternatively, you can add your username to docker group and avoid the sudo. 
# Also, these are some of the bare minimum options that are good to specify. These are in no way exhaustive.

# List Images in Container Registry
docker ls

# Check for running containers
docker ps

# stop a container - get container ID from docker ps
docker stop <container_id>

# start a container - get container ID from docker ps
docker start <container_id>

# log into container - get container ID from docker ps
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

# --name - Name to be given to the container after it spawns
# -d - Detached mode, container runs as a background process
# -p - port mapping (in our example, the traffic at port 7005 of VM will be forwarded to port 8082 of container)

# Tailing logs
docker logs <container_id> -f

# Remove all docker containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

# Remove all docker images
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)
