# Model-Centric vs System-Wide Focus

----
## Traditional Model Focus (Data Science)

![](pipeline.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

Focus: building models from given data, evaluating accuracy


----
## Automating Pipelines and MLOps (ML Engineering)

![](pipeline2.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

Focus: experimenting, deploying, scaling training and serving, model monitoring and updating

----
## MLOps Infrastructure

Note: Figure from Google’s 2015 technical debt paper, indicating that the amount of code for actual model training is comparably small compared to lots of infrastructure code needed to automate model training, serving, and monitoring. These days, much of this infrastructure is readily available through competing MLOps tools (e.g., serving infrastructure, feature stores, cloud resource management, monitoring).

## Problems with Guided Chats

Non-AI guided chat was too limited
* Cannot enumerate problems
* Hard to match against open entries ("I want to file for bankruptcy" vs "I have no money")

Involving human operators very expensive 

Old-fashioned
<!-- col -->
![Baseline: Guided chat](guidedchat.png)

----
## Initial Goal: Better Chatbot

* Help users with simple task
* Connect them with lawyers when needed
* Modernize appearence; "future of digital marketing"

----
## Buy or Build?

[![Botsify website](botsify.png)](https://botsify.com/)

Note: One of many commercial frameworks for building AI chatbots

----
## Data science challenges

* **Infrastructure:** Understand chat bot infrastructure and its capabilities
* **Knowing topics:** Identify what users talk about, train/test concepts with past chat logs
  * "*We fed VocabX a line deliberately trying to confuse it. We wrote, ‘I am thinking about chapter 13 in Boston divorce filing.’ VocabX figured out the two topics: (1) business and industrial/company/bankruptcy (2) society/social institution/divorce.*"

* **Guiding conversations:** Supporting open-ended conversations requires detecting what's on topic and finding a good response; intent-topic modeling
  * *Is talk about parents and children on topic when discussing divorce?*
  * Data gathering/labeling very challenging -- too many corner cases

----
## Stepping Back: System Goals

What are the goals of the system?

<!-- discussion -->

----
## Status meeting with (inhouse) Customer

<!-- smallish -->
The chatbot performed better than before but was far from ready for deployment. There were “too many edge cases” in which conversations did not go as planned. 

**Customer:** "Maybe we need to think about it like an 80/20 rule. In some cases, it works well, but for some, it is harder. 80% everything is fine, and in the remaining 20%, we try to do our best."

**Data science lead:** The trouble is how to automatically recognize what is 80 and what is 20.

**Customer:** I agree. Let us focus on that. We just want value. Tech is secondary.

**Data scientist:** It is harder than it sounds. One of the models is a matching model trained on pairs of legal questions and answers. 60,000 of them. It seems large but is small for ML.

**Customer:** That’s a lot. Can it answer a question about say visa renewal?

**Data scientist:** If there exists a question like that in training data, then yes. But with just 60,000, the model can easily overfit, and then for anything outside, it would just fail.

**Customer:** I see what you are saying. Edge cases are interesting from an academic perspective, but for a business the first and foremost thing is value. You are trying to solve an interesting problem. I get it. But I feel that you may have already solved it enough to gain business value.

Note: Adapted from Passi, S., & Sengers, P. (2020). [Making data science systems work](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951720939605). Big Data & Society, 7(2).

----
## System Goal for Chatbot

* Collect user data to sell to lawyers
* Signal technical competency to lawyers
* Acceptable to fail: Too complicated for self-help, connect with lawyer
* Solving edge cases not important

> "Edge cases are important, but the end goal is user information, monetizing user data. We are building a legal self-help chatbot, but a major business use case is to tell people: ‘here, talk to this lawyer.’ We do want to connect them with a lawyer. Even for 20%, when our bot fails, we tell users that the problem cannot be done through self-help. Let us get you a lawyer, right? That is what we wanted in the first place."

## Model vs System Goal?

<!-- .element: class="plain" -->


----
## More Accurate Predictions may not be THAT Important

* "Good enough" may be good enough
* Prediction critical for system success or just an gimmick?
* Better predictions may come at excessive costs 
    - need way more data, much longer training times
    - privacy concerns
* Better user interface ("experience") may mitigate many problems
    - e.g. explain decisions to users
* Use only high-confidence predictions?





----
## Machine learning that matters

* 2012 essay lamenting focus on algorithmic improvements and benchmarks in ML
  - focus on standard benchmark sets, not engaging with problem: Iris classification, digit recognition, ...
  - focus on abstract metrics, not measuring real-world impact: accuracy, ROC
  - distant from real-world concerns
  - lack of follow-through, no deployment, no impact
* Failure to *reproduce* and *productionize* paper contributions common
* Ignoring design choices in how to collect data, what problem to solve, how to design human-AI interface, measuring impact, ...
*
* Should focus on making impact -- requires building systems

# On Terminology

* There is no standard term for referring to building systems with AI components
* **ML-Enabled Systems**, *Production ML Systems*, *AI-Enabled Systems*,  or *ML-Infused Systems*; *SE4AI*, *SE4ML*
* sometimes **AI Engineering** -- but usually used with a ML-pipeline focus
* **MLOps** ~ technical infrastructure automating ML pipelines
* sometimes **ML Systems Engineering** -- but often this refers to building distributed and scalable ML and data storage platforms
* "AIOps" ~ using AI to make automated decisions in operations; "DataOps" ~ use of agile methods and automation in business data analytics
* My preference: **Production Systems with Machine-Learning Components**

## ML Predictions have Consequences

* Assistance, productivity, creativity
* Manipulation, polarization, discrimination
* Feedback loops
*
* Need for **responsible engineering**

----
## Safety is a System Property

* Code/models are not unsafe, cannot harm people
* Systems can interact with the environment in ways that are unsafe

----
## Safety Assurance in the Model/outside the Model

> Goal: Ensure smart toaster does not burn the kitchen

<!-- discussion -->

----
## Safety Assurance in the Model/outside the Model

<!-- colstart -->
* In the model
  - Ensure maximum toasting time
  - Use heat sensor and past outputs for prediction
  - Hard to make guarantees
* Outside the model (e.g., "guardrails")
  - Simple code check for max toasting time
  - Non-ML rule to shut down if too hot
  - Hardware solution: thermal fuse

----
## Model vs System Properties

* Similar to safety, many other qualities should be discussed at model **and** system level
  - Security
  - Privacy
  - Transparency, accountability
  - Maintainability
  - Scalability, energy consumption
  - Impact on system goals
  - ...




----
## Thinking about Systems

* Holistic approach, looking at the larger picture, involving all stakeholders
* Looking at relationships and interactions among components and environments
    - Everything is interconnected
    - Combining parts creates something new with emergent behavior
    - Understand dynamics, be aware of feedback loops, actions have effects
* Understand how humans interact with the system

> A system is a set of inter-related components that work together in a particular environment to perform whatever functions are required to achieve the system's objective -- Donella Meadows

# Designing Intelligent Experiences

(Human-AI Interaction)

----
## AI predictions should influence the world

* Smart toaster
* Automated slide design
* Product or music recommendations
* Feed curation in social media or news
* Recidivism prediction
* Health monitoring
* Transcription services
* Image search engine
* Self-driving cars
* Smart home
*
* Interact with the world through actuators (smart devices) or by influencing people



----
## Designing Intelligent Experiences

* How to use the output of a model's prediction (for a objective)?
* Design considerations:
    - How to present prediction to a user? Suggestions or automatically take actions?
    - How to effectively influence the user's behavior toward the system's goal?
    - How to minimize the consequences of flawed predictions?
    - How to collect data to continue to learn from users and mistakes?
* Balancing at least three **system-level** outcomes:
    - Achieving objectives
    - Protection from mistakes
    - Collecting data for training


----
## Presenting Intelligence

* Automate: Take action on user's behalf

* Prompt: Ask the user if an action should be taken

* Organize: Display a set of items in an order

* Annotate: Add information to a display

* Hybrids of these


----
## Factors to Consider


* **Forcefulness**: How strongly to encourage taking an action (or even automate it)?
* **Frequency**: How often to interact with the user?
* **Value**: How much does a user (think to) benefit from the prediction?
* **Cost**: What is the damage of a wrong prediction?

----
## Shifting from Models to Pipelines is Challenging

Across interviews with enterprise ML teams:

* Data scientists often focus on modeling in local environment, model-centric workflow
* Rarely robust infrastructure, often monolithic and tangled
* Challenges in deploying systems and integration with monitoring, streams etc
* 
* Shifting to pipeline-centric workflow challenging
* Requires writing robust programs, slower, less exploratory
* Standardized, modular infrastructure 
* 
* Big conceptual leap, major hurdle to adoption

# ML Challenges System Decomposition

(deductive vs inductive reasoning)


----
## Complexity in Engineered Systems

![Airplane](airplane.jpg)

* Automobile: ~30,000 parts; Airplane: ~3,000,000 parts
* MS Office: ~ 40,000,000 LOCs; Debian: ~ 400,000,000 LOCs
* How do we build such complex systems?

----
## Managing Complexity in Software

* **Abstraction**: Hide details & focus on high-level behaviors
* **Reuse**: Package into reusable libraries & APIs with well-defined _contracts_
* **Composition**: Build large components out of smaller ones


![](system.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->


----
## Managing Complexity in Software

* **Abstraction**: Hide details & focus on high-level behaviors
* **Reuse**: Package into reusable libraries & APIs with well-defined _contracts_
* **Composition**: Build large components out of smaller ones

```java
/**
 * compute deductions based on provided adjusted 
 * gross income and expenses in customer data.
 *
 * see tax code 26 U.S. Code A.1.B, PART VI
 *
 * Adjusted gross income must be positive; 
 * returned deductions are not negative.
 */
float computeDeductions(float agi, Expenses expenses) {
  ...
}
```


----
## Divide and Conquer

* Human cognitive ability is limited
* Decomposition of software necessary to handle complexity
* Allows division of labor
* Deductive reasoning, using logic

![Tax computation system with three components](tax-decomposition.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


----
## Debugging and Assigning Blame

* Each component has own specification
* For each input, specification indicates whether output correct

```java
/**
 * compute deductions based on provided adjusted 
 * gross income and expenses in customer data.
 *
 * see tax code 26 U.S. Code A.1.B, PART VI
 */
float computeDeductions(float agi, Expenses expenses);
```

![Tax computation system with three components](tax-decomposition.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

----
## Strict Correctness Assumption

* Specification determines which outputs are correct/wrong
* Not "pretty good", "95% accurate", or "correct for 98% of all users"
* A single wrong result indicates a bug in the system

![Tax computation system with three components](tax-decomposition.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Note: A single wrong tax prediction would be a bug. No tolerance of occasional wrong predictions, approximations, nondeterminism.

----
## Image Captioning Algorithm


![Image captioning one step](imgcaptioning.png)

```java
/**
  ????
*/
String getCaption(Image img);
```

Note: We do not know how to program this or specify this.
No way of saying whether caption is "correct" for input, but defer to human judgement.

----
## Learning Image Captioning Algorithm

![Image captioning with ML](imgcaptioningml.png)


*Learning rules by fitting to examples, no specification, inductive reasoning*

Note: "Rules"/algorithm learned from data. Still no specification. Best fit to given training data.

----
## Correctness of Model?

Note: Human judgment needed. Furthermore, a single bad example is not a problem.

----
## Weak Correctness Assumptions

* Often no reliable ground truth (e.g. human judgment)
* Accepting that mistakes will happen, hopefully not to frequently; "95% accuracy" may be pretty good
* More confident for data similar to training data

![Example of wrong caption](imgcaptioning-cake.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


----
## Specifications in Machine Learning?

* Usually clear specifications do not exist -- we use machine learning exactly because we do not know the specifications
* Can define correctness for some data, but not general rules; sometimes can only determine correctness after the fact
* Learning for tasks for which we cannot write specifications
  * Too complex
  * Rules unknown
* ML will learn rules/specifications (inductive reasoning), often not in a human-readable form, but are those the right ones?
* 
* Usually goals used instead --> maximize a specific objective

----

## Deductive Reasoning

* Combining logical statements following agreed upon rules to form new statements
* Proving theorems from axioms
* From general to the particular
* *mathy reasoning, eg. proof that π is irrational*
* 
* Formal methods, classic rule-based AI systems, expert systems

<!-- split -->

## Inductive Reasoning

* Constructing axioms from observations
* Strong evidence suggests a rule
* From particular to the general
* *sciency reasoning, eg. finding laws of nature*
* 
* Most modern machine learning systems, statistical learning


----
## Consequences from Lack of Specifications

<!-- discussion -->


Note: Breaks many traditional assumptions and foundations for compositional reasoning and divide and conquer

Poorly understood interactions between models:
Ideally, develop models separately & compose together.
In general, must train & tune together.

----
## Takeaway: Shift in Design Thinking?

Breaking traditional decomposition and reasoning strategies... 

From deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning...

From clear specifications to goals...

From guarantees to best effort...

**What does this mean for software engineering?**

**For decomposing software systems?** 

**For correctness of AI-enabled systems?** 

**For safety?**

**For design, implementation, testing, deployment, operations?**


*These problems are not new, but are exacerbated by the increasing use of ML!*

























---
# Summary

* Production AI-enabled systems require a *whole system perspective*, beyond just the model or the pipeline
* Distinguish system goals from model goals
* Quality at a *system* level: safety beyond the model, beyond accuracy
* Plan for operations (telemetry, updates)
* Large design space for user interface (intelligent experience): forcefulness, frequency, telemetry
