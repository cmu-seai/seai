## Deploying a Model is Easy

Model inference component as function/library

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = ‚Ä¶ # learn model or load serialized model ...
def infer(feature1, feature2):
    return model.predict(np.array([[feature1, feature2]])
```

----
## Deploying a Model is Easy

Model inference component as a service


```python
from flask import Flask, escape, request
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = '/tmp/uploads'
detector_model = ‚Ä¶ # load model‚Ä¶

# inference API that returns JSON with classes 
# found in an image
@app.route('/get_objects', methods=['POST'])
def pred():
    uploaded_img = request.files["images"]
    coverted_img = ‚Ä¶ # feature encoding of uploaded img
    result = detector_model(converted_img)
    return jsonify({"response":
                result['detection_class_entities']})

```

----
## Deploying a Model is Easy

Packaging a model inference service in a container


```docker
FROM python:3.8-buster
RUN pip install uwsgi==2.0.20
RUN pip install numpy==1.22.0
RUN pip install tensorflow==2.7.0
RUN pip install flask==2.0.2
RUN pip install gunicorn==20.1.0
COPY models/model.pf /model/
COPY ./serve.py /app/main.py
WORKDIR ./app
EXPOSE 4040
CMD ["gunicorn", "-b 0.0.0.0:4040", "main:app"]
```

----
## Deploying a Model is Easy

Model inference component as a service in the cloud

* Package in container or other infrastructure
* Deploy in cloud infrastructure
* Auto-scaling with demand
* MLOps infrastructure to automate all of this
* (more on this later)
*
* Model inference is stateless and embarrassingly parallel
* Almost always deterministic
* "*Stateless Serving Functions Pattern*"
* Lots of tooling available, including 
    * [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) (low code service creation, deployment, model registry), 
    * [Cortex](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) (automated deployment and scaling of models on AWS), 
    * [TFX model serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) (tensorflow GRPC services)
    * [Seldon Core](https://www.seldon.io/tech/products/core/) (no-code model service and many many additional services for monitoring and operations on Kubernetes)


----
## But is it really easy?

* Offline use?
* Deployment at scale?
* Hardware needs and operating cost?
* Frequent updates?
* Integration of the model into a system?
* Meeting system requirements?
* Every system is different!

----
## Every System is Different

* Personalized music recommendations for Spotify
* Transcription service startup
* Self-driving car
* Smart keyboard for mobile device

## Software Architecture

> The software architecture of a program or computing system is the **structure or structures** of the system, which comprise **software elements**, the ***externally visible properties*** of those elements, and the relationships among them.
> -- [Kazman et al. 2012](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/?ar)

## Recall: Systems Thinking

![](system.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

> A system is a set of inter-related components that work together in a particular environment to perform whatever functions are required to achieve the system's objective -- Donella Meadows

----

## Why Architecture? ([Kazman et al. 2012](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780132942799/?ar))

* Represents earliest design decisions.
* Aids in **communication** with stakeholders
    * Shows them ‚Äúhow‚Äù at a level they can understand, raising questions about whether it meets their needs
* Defines **constraints** on implementation
    * Design decisions form ‚Äúload-bearing walls‚Äù of application
* Dictates **organizational structure**
    * Teams work on different components
* Inhibits or enables **quality attributes**
    * Similar to design patterns
* Supports **predicting** cost, quality, and schedule
    * Typically by predicting information for each component
* Aids in software **evolution**
    * Reason about cost, design, and effect of changes
* Aids in **prototyping**
    * Can implement architectural skeleton early

## Twitter - Caching Architecture

![twitter](twitter-caching.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Notes:

* Running one of the world‚Äôs largest Ruby on Rails installations
* 200 engineers
* Monolithic: managing raw database, memcache, rendering the site, and * presenting the public APIs in one codebase
* Increasingly difficult to understand system; organizationally challenging to manage and parallelize engineering teams
* Reached the limit of throughput on our storage systems (MySQL); read and write hot spots throughout our databases
* Throwing machines at the problem; low throughput per machine (CPU + RAM limit, network not saturated)
* Optimization corner: trading off code readability vs performance

----

## Twitter's Redesign Goals

* Performance
    * Improve median latency; lower outliers 
    * Reduce number of machines 10x
+ Reliability
    * Isolate failures
+ Maintainability
    * "We wanted cleaner boundaries with ‚Äúrelated‚Äù logic being in one place": 
encapsulation and modularity at the systems level (rather than at the class, module, or package level)
* Modifiability
    * Quicker release of new features: "run small and empowered engineering teams that could make local decisions and ship user-facing changes, independent of other teams"

## Twitter Case Study: Key Insights

* Architectural decisions affect entire systems, not only individual modules
* Abstract, different abstractions for different scenarios
* Reason about quality attributes early
* Make architectural decisions explicit

## Analysis-Specific Abstractions

* All maps were abstractions of the same real-world construct
* All maps were created with different goals in mind
    - Different relevant abstractions
    - Different reasoning opportunities

# Design Decision: Selecting ML Algorithms

What ML algorithms to use and why? Tradeoffs?

![](googletranslate.png)

Notes: Relate back to previous lecture about AI technique tradeoffs, including for example
Accuracy
Capabilities (e.g. classification, recommendation, clustering‚Ä¶)
Amount of training data needed
Inference latency
Learning latency; incremental learning?
Model size
Explainable? Robust?

---
# Design Decision: Where Should the Model Live?

(Deployment Architecture)

----
## Where Should the Models Live?

![AR Translation Architecture Sketch](ar-architecture.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

Cloud? Phone? Glasses?

What qualities are relevant for the decision?

Notes: Trigger initial discussion


----
## Considerations

* How much data is needed as input for the model?
* How much output data is produced by the model?
* How fast/energy consuming is model execution?
* What latency is needed for the application?
* How big is the model? How often does it need to be updated?
* Cost of operating the model? (distribution + execution)
* Opportunities for telemetry?
* What happens if users are offline?

----
## Breakout: Latency and Bandwidth Analysis of AR Translation

1. Estimate latency and bandwidth requirements between components

2. Discuss tradeoffs among different deployment models

![AR Translation Architecture Sketch](ar-architecture.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain stretch" -->

Post on Slack in `#lecture`:
* Recommended deployment for OCR (with justification):
* Recommended deployment for Translation (with justification):




Notes: Identify at least OCR and Translation service as two AI components in a larger system. Discuss which system components are worth modeling (e.g., rendering, database, support forum). Discuss how to get good estimates for latency and bandwidth.

Some data:
200ms latency is noticable as speech pause; 
20ms is perceivable as video delay, 10ms as haptic delay;
5ms referenced as cybersickness threshold for virtual reality
20ms latency might be acceptable

bluetooth latency around 40ms to 200ms

bluetooth bandwidth up to 3mbit, wifi 54mbit, video stream depending on quality 4 to 10mbit for low to medium quality

google glasses had 5 megapixel camera, 640x360 pixel screen, 1 or 2gb ram, 16gb storage

## From the Reading: When would one use the following designs?

* Static intelligence in the product
* Client-side intelligence (user-facing devices)
* Server-centric intelligence
* Back-end cached intelligence
* Hybrid models
*
* Consider: Offline use, inference latency, model updates, application updates, operating cost, scalability, protecting intellectual property

<!-- discussion -->

Notes:
From the reading:
* Static intelligence in the product
    - difficult to update
    - good execution latency
    - cheap operation
    - offline operation
    - no telemetry to evaluate and improve
* Client-side intelligence
    - updates costly/slow, out of sync problems
    - complexity in clients
    - offline operation, low execution latency
* Server-centric intelligence
    - latency in model execution (remote calls)
    - easy to update and experiment
    - operation cost
    - no offline operation
* Back-end cached intelligence
    - precomputed common results
    - fast execution, partial offline 
    - saves bandwidth, complicated updates
* Hybrid models


----
## Where Should Feature Encoding Happen?

![Feature Encoding](featureencoding.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->

*Should feature encoding happen server-side or client-side? Tradeoffs?*

Note: When thinking of model inference as a component within a system, feature encoding can happen with the model-inference component or can be the responsibility of the client. That is, the client either provides the raw inputs (e.g., image files; dotted box in the figure above) to the inference service or the client is responsible for computing features and provides the feature vector to the inference service (dashed box). Feature encoding and model inference could even be two separate services that are called by the client in sequence. Which alternative is preferable is a design decision that may depend on a number of factors, for example, whether and how the feature vectors are stored in the system, how expensive computing the feature encoding is, how often feature encoding changes, how many models use the same feature encoding, and so forth. For instance, in our stock photo example, having feature encoding being part of the inference service is convenient for clients and makes it easy to update the model without changing clients, but we would have to send the entire image over the network instead of just the much smaller feature vector for the reduced 300 x 300 pixels.


----
## Reusing Feature Engineering Code


![Feature encoding shared between training and inference](shared-feature-encoding.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain" -->


Avoid *training‚Äìserving skew*

----
## The Feature Store Pattern

* Central place to store, version, and describe feature engineering code
* Can be reused across projects
* Possible caching of expensive features


Many open source and commercial offerings, e.g.,  Feast, Tecton, AWS SageMaker Feature Store

----
## Tecton Feature Store

----
## More Considerations for Deployment Decisions

* Coupling of ML pipeline parts
* Coupling with other parts of the system
* Ability for different developers and analysts to collaborate
* Support online experiments
* Ability to monitor


----

# Preview: Telemetry Design

----
## Telemetry Design

How to evaluate system performance and mistakes in production?

![](googletranslate.png)

Notes: Discuss strategies to determine accuracy in production. What kind of telemetry needs to be collected?

----
## The Right and Right Amount of Telemetry

* Purpose:
    - Monitor operation
    - Monitor mistakes (e.g., accuracy)
    - Improve models over time (e.g., detect new features)
*
* Challenges:
    - too much data
    - no/not enough data
    - hard to measure, poor proxy measures
    - rare events
    - cost
    - privacy
*
* **Interacts with deployment decisions**

----
## Telemetry Tradeoffs

What data to collect? How much? When?

Estimate data volume and possible bottlenecks in system.

![](googletranslate.png)

Notes: Discuss alternatives and their tradeoffs. Draw models as suitable.

Some data for context:
Full-screen png screenshot on Pixel 2 phone (1080x1920) is about 2mb (2 megapixel); Google glasses had a 5 megapixel camera and a 640x360 pixel screen, 16gb of storage, 2gb of RAM. Cellar cost are about $10/GB.

## Why Documentation

* Model inference between teams:
  * Data scientists developing the model
  * Other data scientists using the model, evolving the model
  * Software engineers integrating the model as a component
  * Operators managing model deployment
* Will this model work for my problem?
* What problems to anticipate?

----
## Classic API Documentation


```java
/**
 * compute deductions based on provided adjusted 
 * gross income and expenses in customer data.

  "boundingPoly": {
    object (BoundingPoly)
  }
}
```
From Google‚Äôs public [object detection API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/object-localizer).

----
## Documentation beyond Input/Output Types
