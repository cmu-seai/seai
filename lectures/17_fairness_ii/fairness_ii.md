# Fairness Definitions: Review


----
## Review of definitions so far:

*Recidivism scenario: Should a person be detained?*

* Anti-classification: ?
* Group fairness: ?
* Separation: ?

<!-- split -->

![Courtroom](courtroom.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


----
## Review of definitions so far:

*Recidivism scenario: Should a defendant be detained?*

* Anti-classification: Race and gender should not be considered for the decision at all
* Group fairness: Detention rates should be equal across gender and race groups
* Separation: Among defendants who would not have gone on to commit a
violent crime if released, detention rates are equal across gender and race groups

__Q. But how do we decide which of these definitions to use?__

# Requirements Engineering for Fairness


----
## Recall: Machine vs World

![](machine-world.png)

* No ML/AI lives in vacuum; every system is deployed as part of the world
* A requirement describes a desired state of the world (i.e., environment)
* Machine (software) is _created_ to manipulate the environment into
this state

----
## Requirements for Fair ML Systems

* Understand the environment and its assumptions
	<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Who are the stakeholders? Any disadvantaged groups?
	* What is the target population distribution like?
* Identify fairness requirements 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* What is the ultimate goal of the system being developed?
	* What types of harm can be caused as side effects?
	* Are we trying to achieve equality vs. equity? 
	* Are there are any legal requirements to consider?
	
----
## "Four-fifth rule" (or "80% rule")

$(P[R = 1 | A = a]) / (P[R = 1 | A = b]) \geq 0.8$

* Selection rate for a protected group (e.g., $A = a$) <
80% of highest rate => selection procedure considered as having "adverse
impact"
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Guideline adopted by Federal agencies (Department of Justice, Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, etc.,) in 1978
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* If violated, must justify business necessity (i.e., the selection procedure is
essential to the safe & efficient operation)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Example: Hiring
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * 50% of male applicants vs 20% female applicants hired
  (0.2/0.5 = 0.4)
  * Is there a business justification for hiring men at a higher rate?


----
## Recall: Equality vs Equity

![Contrasting equality, equity, and justice](eej2.jpeg)


----
## Requirements for Fair ML Systems

* Understand the environment and its assumptions 
	* Who are the stakeholders? Any disadvantaged groups? 
	* What is the target population distribution like?
* Identify fairness requirements 
	* What is the ultimate goal of the system being developed?
	* What types of harm can be caused as side effects?
	* Are we trying to achieve equality vs. equity? 
	* Are there are any legal requirements to consider?	
* Define the interface between the environment & machine (ML)
	<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* What data will be sensed/measured by AI? Potential biases?
	* What types of decisions will the system make? Punitive or assistive?



----
## Type of Decision & Possible Harm

* If the decision is punitive in nature:
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Harm is caused when a protected group is given an unwarranted penalty
  * e.g. decide whom to deny bail based on risk of recidivism
  * Heuristic: Use a fairness metric (separation) based on __false positive rate__
* If the decision is assistive in nature:
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Harm is caused when a group in need is incorrectly denied assistance
  * e.g., decide who should receive a loan or a food subsidy
  * Heuristic: Use a fairness metric based on __false negative rate__

<!-- <\!-- split -\-> -->

<!-- * Decision: Classify whether a defendant should be detained -->
<!-- * Criteria: Anti-classification, independence, or seperation w/ FPR or FNR? -->


----
## Which fairness criteria?

![](mri.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Decision: Does the patient has a high risk of cancer?
* What kind of harm can be caused? Punitive or assistive?

## Recidivism Revisited

![](recidivism-propublica.png)

* COMPAS system, developed by Northpointe
	* Used by judges in sentencing decisions
	* In deployment throughout numerous states (PA, FL, NY, WI, CA, etc.,)

<!-- references -->

[ProPublica article](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)


----
## Which fairness definition?

![](compas-metrics.png)

* ProPublica investigation: COMPAS violates separation w/ FPR & FNR
* Northpointe response: COMPAS is fair because it has similar FDRs
  across both races
  * FDR = FP / (FP + TP) = 1 - Precision
  * FPR = FP / (FP + TN)
* __Q. So is COMPAS both fair & unfair at the same time? Which definition
  is the "right" one?__

## Fairness Definitions: Pitfalls 

<!-- ![](fairness-accuracy.jpeg) -->
![](bongo.gif)

* "Impossibility Theorem": Can't satisfy multiple fairness criteria at
  once
* Easy to pick some definition & claim that the model is fair
  * But does a "fair" model really help reduce harm in the long term?
* Instead of trying to "fix" bias through a model, can we understand &
  address the root causes of bias in the first place?
  * Many of these are deeply rooted in our society, and
    can't be solved purely through technical means!

# Dataset Construction for Fairness


----
## Flexibility in Data Collection

* Data science education often assumes data as given
* In industry, we often have control over data collection and curation (65%)
* Most address fairness issues by collecting more data (73%)

## Data Bias

![](data-bias-stage.png)

* Bias can be introduced at any stage of the data pipeline!

----
## Types of Data Bias

* __Population bias__
* __Historical bias__
* __Behavioral bias__
* Content production bias
* Linking bias
* Temporal bias

<!-- references -->

_Social Data: Biases, Methodological Pitfalls, and Ethical
Boundaries_, Olteanu et al., Frontiers in Big Data (2016).

----
## Population Bias

![](facial-dataset.png)

* Differences in demographics between a dataset vs a target population
* May result in degraded services for certain groups (e.g., poor
  image recognition for females & darker skin types)
* Another example: Demographics on social media

<!-- references -->

Merler, Ratha, Feris, and Smith. [Diversity in Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10436)

----
## Historical Bias

![Image search for "CEO"](ceo.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

* Dataset matches the reality, but certain groups are under- or
over-represented due to historical reasons

----
## Behavioral Bias

![](freelancing.png)

* Differences in user behavior across platforms or social contexts
* Example: Freelancing platforms (Fiverr vs TaskRabbit)
  * Bias against certain minority groups on different platforms

<!-- references -->

_Bias in Online Freelance Marketplaces_, Hannak et al., CSCW (2017).

----
## Fairness-Aware Data Collection

* Address population bias
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Does the dataset reflect the demographics in the target
  population?
  * If not, collect more data to achieve this
* Address under- & over-representation issues
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Ensure sufficient amount of data for all groups to avoid being
	treated as "outliers" by ML
	* Also avoid over-representation of certain groups (e.g.,
     remove historical data)
* Data augmentation: Synthesize data for minority groups to reduce under-representation
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Observed: "He is a doctor" -> synthesize "She is a doctor"
* Fairness-aware active learning
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Evaluate accuracy across different groups
  * Collect more data for groups with highest error rates

  t[biased training data] --> o[biased outcomes]
  o --> m[biased telemetry] 
  m --> t
  ```

> "Big Data processes codify the past.  They do not invent the future.  Doing that requires moral imagination, and that’s something only humans can provide. " -- Cathy O'Neil in [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/6lpsnm/alma991016462699704436)


----
## Example: Predictive Policing

![Crime Map](crime-map.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->


* Model: Use historical data to predict crime rates by neighborhoods
* Increased patrol => more arrested made in neighborhood X
* New crime data fed back to the model
* Repeat...

__Q. Other examples?__

----
## Long-term Impact of ML

![](ml-cycle.png)

* ML systems make multiple decisions over time, influence the
behaviors of populations in the real world
* But most models are built & optimized assuming that the world is
static!
* Difficult to estimate the impact of ML over time
  * Need to reason about the system dynamics (world vs machine)
  * e.g., what's the effect of a loan lending policy on a population?

----
## Long-term Impact & Fairness

![](fairness-longterm.png)

* Deploying an ML model with a fairness criterion does NOT guarantee
  improvement in equality/equity over time
* Even if a model appears to promote fairness in
short term, it may result harm over a long-term period

# Monitoring and Auditing

----
## Monitoring & Auditing

* Continuously monitor for:
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Mismatch between training data, test data, and instances that you encounter in deployment
  - Fairness metrics: Is the system yielding fair results over time?
  - Population shifts: May suggest needs to adjust fairness metric/thresholds
  - User reports & complaints: Log and audit system decisions
    perceived to be unfair by users
* Deploy escalation plans: How do you respond when harm occurs due to
system?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Shutdown system? Temporary replacement?
	* Maintain communication lines to stakeholders
* Invite diverse stakeholders to audit system for biases
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----
## Monitoring & Auditing

![](model_drift.jpg)

* Continously monitor the fairness metric (e.g., error rates for
different groups)
* Re-train model with recent data or adjust classification thresholds if needed
* Recall: Data drifts in the Data Quality lecture

----
## Monitoring Tools: Example

![](aequitas.png)

http://aequitas.dssg.io/

----
## Monitoring Tools: Example

![](aequitas-report.png)

* Continuously make fairness measurements to detect potential shifts
  in data, population behavior, etc.,

----
## Monitoring Tools: Example

![](aequitas-process.png)

* Involve policy makers in the monitoring & auditing process

# Building Fair ML-Based Systems: Best Practices

----
## START EARLY!

* Think about system goals and relevant fairness concerns
* Analyze risks & harms to affected groups
* Understand environment interactions, attacks, and feedback loops (world vs machine)
* Influence data acquisition
* Define quality assurance procedures
  - separate test sets, automatic fairness measurement, testing in production
  - telemetry design and feedback mechanisms
  - incidence response plan


----
## Best Practices: Task Definition

* Clearly define the task & model’s intended effects
* Try to identify and document unintended effects & biases
* Clearly define any fairness requirements
* *Involve diverse stakeholders & multiple perspectives*
* Refine the task definition & be willing to abort

* Check for biases in cultural context of data source
* Check that data source matches deployment context
* Check for biases in
  * technology used to collect the data
  * humans involved in collecting data
  * sampling strategy
* *Ensure sufficient representation of subpopulations*
* Check that collection process itself is fair & ethical

*How can we achieve fairness without putting a tax on already disadvantaged populations?*

----
## Best Practices: Model Definition and Training

* Clearly define all assumptions about model
* Try to identify biases present in assumptions
* Check whether model structure introduces biases
