## Are Data Scientists Disappearing?

> However, AutoML does not spell the end of data scientists, as it doesn’t “AutoSelect” a business problem to solve, it doesn’t AutoSelect indicative data, it doesn’t AutoAlign stakeholders, it doesn’t provide AutoEthics in the face of potential bias, it doesn’t provide AutoIntegration with the rest of your product, and it doesn’t provide AutoMarketing after the fact. -- [Frederik Bussler](https://towardsdatascience.com/will-automl-be-the-end-of-data-scientists-9af3e63990e0)

![Tweet: "Virtually *everyone* is / will soon be building ML applications. Only few can afford dedicated software engineers to team up with, or SE education for themselves. It would be more inclusive to build SE into the ML processes more fundamentally, so that everyone could build better"](virtuallyeveryone.png)

*(better tools don't replace the knowledge to use them)*

## My View 

> This is an education problem, more than a research problem. 

> Interdisciplinary teams, mutual awareness and understanding

> Software engineers and data scientists will each play an essential role

## DevOps as a Role Model

Joint responsibilities, joint processes, joint tools, joint vocabulary

## Some things we tried

* Scaling the class!
* Stable TA-team mapping and checkins
* In-class interactions despite large room
* In-class breakouts, posting to slack
*
* Clear specifications for homework, pass/fail grading, allow resubmission
* Open-ended reading quizzes
* "Individual" assignments and readings in pairs
* Credit for social activities in teams
* Team checkins, peer grading for "team citizenship"
* Slack for coordination and questions

----
## Feedback

* What was useful?
* What could be improved?
* Where did we overdo it with the homework?
* Ideas for better scaling?
* How to better support teamwork?
